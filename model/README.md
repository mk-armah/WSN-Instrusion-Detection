Intrusion Detection In Wireless Sensor Networks


Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) is very essential technology to keep the people away from cyber-attack. Every
transaction and information processing is take place through Internet which is very prone to more different types of
malicious activity [1]. 

Features

isCH - A flag to distinguish whether the node is CH with value 1 or normal node with value 0.

Dist_To_CH - The distance between the node and its CH in the current round.

ADV_S - The number of advertise CHâ€™s broadcast messages sent to the nodes.

ADV_R - The number of advertise CH messages received from CHs

JOIN_S - The number of join request messages sent by the nodes to the CH

JOIN_R - The number of join request messages received by the CH from the nodes.

SCH_S - The number of advertise TDMA schedule broadcast messages sent to the nodes.
